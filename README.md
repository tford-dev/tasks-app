This react App is the front end for my https://github.com/tford-dev/tasks-app-api api. This app is simply a notes app that implements user authentication. I personally made this app to get myself used to using CSS again. I hope to add more features to this in the future. Short term, I'd like to make a Java or C# back end for this app.
